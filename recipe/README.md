# CS472 (WAP)


## Intro :sunglasses:

This assignment tests your understanding of basic HTML and CSS. You will create several files related to a recipe web site for a fictional pie company named Granny's Pies.


## Extra Features :star:

1. I set the overall page to use the silverware background image.
2. I set the page's favicon to pie-icon.gif.
3. I set all bulleted list items on the page to use pie-icon.gif.
4. I set the letter spacing for all headings to 0.25em.
5. I made sure that the gray background behind the headings on the page is only behind the text itself, not stretched across the entire width of the page.
6. I added padding to the headings
