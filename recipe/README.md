3. I set all bulleted list items on the page to use pie-icon.gif.
4. I set the letter spacing for all headings to 0.25em.
5. I made sure that the gray background behind the headings on the page is only behind the text itself, not stretched across the entire width of the page.
6. I added padding to the headings
