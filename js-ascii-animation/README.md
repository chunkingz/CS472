# CS472 (WAP)


## Intro :sunglasses:

This assignment tests your understanding of JavaScript and its interaction with HTML user interfaces.
ASCII art is pictures that consist of text characters. ASCII art has a long history as a way to draw pictures for textonly monitors or printers. We will draw animated ASCII art, or "ASCIImation." Groups of nerds are working to recreate the entire movies Star Wars and The Matrix as ASCIImation.


## Extra Features :star:

The app should have these elements:
- A header
- Text area for displaying the animation
- controls for:
    - starting and stopping the animation
    - choosing the type of animation
    - choosing the size of the animation
    - setting the animation speed (50ms or 250ms)
- Verification stickers in the footer.
