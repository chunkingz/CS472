# CS472 (WAP)


## Intro :sunglasses:

This lab practices unobtrusive JavaScript events and the Document Object Model (DOM). We'll write a page with a "maze" to navigate with the mouse.
The difficulty is in having the dexterity to move the mouse through without touching any walls. When the mouse cursor touches a wall, all walls turn red and a "You lose" message shows. Touching the Start button with the mouse removes the red coloring from the walls.


## Extra Features :star:

The app should have these elements:
- Displaying the maze.
- Make all boundaries glow red on hover and display a "You lose!" message.
- Make sure that when the user reaches the end of the maze, a "You win!" message appears.
- Make sure that when the user clicks the Start (S), the maze state will reset. 
- h4x0rz only (Disallow cheating)
    - make sure that after the user clicks "S" if they move outside the maze, a "You lose!" message is displayed and the maze walls will light up red.
