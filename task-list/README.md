# CS472 (WAP)


## Intro :sunglasses:

The Task List Application is a Web Application that allows the User to enter and save a list of tasks. 
Each task is described with a short piece of text. 
The User enters the task description in the Task box and then clicks the Add Task button to append the description to the end of the Task List. 
When the User clicks the Clear Tasks button, the whole Task List is deleted.
The Task List is saved until the User clears it. 
If the User closes the Browser (or the Browser window) and then reopens it later, the same task list will still be there.


## Extra Features :star: 

- Added task list counter
- The input box is cleared once the task has been added to the list.
- On `clear tasks` button clicked, the task list and task counter are reset.
- Added extra CSS for page beautification (header shadows, button shadows and transitions, etc)
